# Bitbucket â†’ GitHub Migration Guide

**Version:** 2.0â€ƒâ€ƒ**Last Updated:** 2025-10-18

---

## Overview

This guide explains how to migrate a **Bitbucket** Cloud repository to **GitHub**, preserving:

* Git history (branches, tags, commits)
* Issues, pull requests, and comments
* Attachments (manual upload required)
* Author and timestamp metadata (as text)

---

!!! warning "Important Safety Note"
    Keep your Bitbucket repository intact (potentially archived) until migration is fully verified. If errors occur and migration is only partially completed, delete the GitHub repository and start fresh.

---

## Installation and Setup

1. **Install from PyPI** (Recommended):
    ```bash
    pipx install bitbucket-migration
    ```
    Then use as follows. See [CLI Reference Guide](reference/cli_reference.md) for detailed description
    of the command line interface of the included scripts.
    ```bash
    audit_bitbucket --workspace YOUR_WORKSPACE --repo YOUR_REPO --generate-config
    migrate_bitbucket_to_github --config migration_config.json --dry-run
    ```

    ??? "Alternative installation methods"

        **Run Directly**
        ```bash
        pipx run bitbucket-migration audit_bitbucket --workspace YOUR_WORKSPACE --repo YOUR_REPO --generate-config
        ```

        **From Source**
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/fkloosterman/bitbucket-migration.git
        cd bitbucket-migration
        python audit_bitbucket.py --workspace YOUR_WORKSPACE --repo YOUR_REPO --generate-config
        ```

2. **Set up Bitbucket and Github Tokens**

    You will need a Bitbucket Cloud API Token (read access to repos, issues, PRs) and
    a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with `repo` scope.
    
    See [API Tokens Setup Guide](reference/api_tokens.md)
    for instructions on how to setup these tokens and to verify access.

## Step-by-Step Migration

### Step 1 â€” Run Audit

Generates the initial configuration and user mapping.

```bash
python audit_bitbucket.py \
  --workspace WORKSPACE \
  --repo REPO \
  --email YOU@DOMAIN \
  --generate-config \
  --gh-owner GITHUB_USER \
  --gh-repo REPO
```

**Outputs**

* `audit_report.md` â€“ summary of repo data
* `migration_config.json` â€“ template for migration
* `user_mapping_template.txt` â€“ list of contributors

**Next:** Edit the config file to map Bitbucket users to GitHub accounts.
See [User Mapping Reference](reference/user_mapping.md).

---

### Step 2 â€” Mirror Repository

1. Create an **empty** repository on GitHub.
   Do *not* add a README or license.
2. Keep it **private** until migration is complete.

```bash
git clone --mirror https://bitbucket.org/WORKSPACE/REPO.git
cd REPO.git
git remote add github https://github.com/OWNER/REPO.git
git push --mirror github
```

Verify:

```bash
git ls-remote github
```

---

### Step 3 - Tailor Configuration

Edit `migration_config.json` to set your tokens and user mappings. See [Migration Config Reference](reference/migration_config.md) for full details.

1. **Update Tokens**
   - Set `bitbucket.token` to your Bitbucket API token.
   - Set `github.token` to your GitHub PAT with `repo` scope.

2. **Configure User Mapping**
   - Map Bitbucket display names to GitHub usernames in `user_mapping`.
   - Set unmapped or deleted users to `null`.

3. **Run Dry Run**
   - After editing, run a dry run (Step 4) to validate.
   - Refine mappings if needed.

??? "Advanced Options"
    - Add `repository_mapping` for cross-repository link rewriting.
    - See [Migration Config Reference](reference/migration_config.md) for details.

---

### Step 4 â€” Dry Run Migration

Run a simulation of the migration to validate your configuration without making any changes.

```bash
python migrate_bitbucket_to_github.py \
  --config migration_config.json \
  --dry-run
```

**What it does:**
- Validates tokens and permissions.
- Checks user mappings and repository access.
- Estimates issue/PR counts and migration time.
- Generates `migration_report_dry_run.md` with details.

**Check for:**
- Authentication success (no 401/403 errors).
- Valid user mappings (no unmapped users warnings).
- Correct counts matching your audit report.
- If issues, refine `migration_config.json` and retry.

??? "Advanced Options"
    - Use `--skip-issues` or `--skip-prs` to test specific phases.
    - See [CLI Reference](reference/cli_reference.md) for all options.

---

### Step 5 â€” Run Full Migration

Execute the actual migration of issues, PRs, comments, and attachments.

```bash
python migrate_bitbucket_to_github.py \
  --config migration_config.json
```

**What it does:**
- Migrates issues and PRs (open PRs stay as PRs; closed PRs become issues).
- Downloads attachments to `attachments_temp/`.
- Generates `migration_mapping.json` for ID cross-references.
- Creates `migration_report.md` with details and any issues.

??? "Advanced Options"
    - Use `--use-gh-cli` for automatic attachment upload.
    - Use `--skip-issues` or `--skip-prs` to migrate selectively.
    - See [CLI Reference](reference/cli_reference.md) for all options.

---

### Step 6 â€” Upload Attachments

Attachments are downloaded locally because GitHubâ€™s API doesnâ€™t support direct upload. Use the `--use-gh-cli` option in the migration script for automated upload, or follow the manual steps below.

#### Automated Upload (Recommended)

Add `--use-gh-cli` to the migration command for automatic attachment upload:

```bash
python migrate_bitbucket_to_github.py --config migration_config.json --use-gh-cli
```

This requires GitHub CLI installed and authenticated.

#### Manual Upload

1. **Locate Files**
    ```bash
    cd attachments_temp/
    ls -lh
    ```

2. **Identify Targets**
    Check GitHub issues for comments like:
    ```markdown
    ðŸ“Ž **Attachment from Bitbucket**: `file.png` (size)
    ```

3. **Upload**
    - Drag and drop files into issue comments on GitHub.
    - Files preview inline or as links.

4. **Verify**
    - Confirm uploads in GitHub issues.

??? "Advanced Options"
    For bulk uploads or prioritization:

    **Bulk Upload with GitHub CLI**
    ```bash
    gh auth login
    cd attachments_temp
    while IFS=',' read -r file issue_num; do
      gh issue comment "$issue_num" --repo OWNER/REPO --body "**Attachment:** $file" --attach "$file"
      sleep 2
    done < attachment_mapping.csv
    ```

    **Prioritization**
    | Priority | Files | Action |
    |----------|-------|--------|
    | Critical | Screenshots, docs | Upload first |
    | Optional | Old files | Skip if needed |

    **Tracking & Cleanup**
    - Create `attachment-status.md` for progress.
    - Backup: `tar -czf attachments_backup.tar.gz attachments_temp/`
    - Delete: `rm -rf attachments_temp/` after verification.

---

### Step 7 â€” Verify and Clean Up

Confirm migration success and finalize the process.

**Essential Checks:**

- Verify Git history: branches, tags, and commits match Bitbucket.
- Check issue/PR counts and content against audit report.
- Spot-check user mentions, comments, and timestamps.
- Confirm attachments are uploaded (if not using --use-gh-cli).

**Clean-Up Operations:**

- Update README with new GitHub links and branch protections.
- Set Bitbucket repo to read-only or archive it.
- Clean up temporary files: `rm -rf attachments_temp/`.
- Archive migration reports and mappings for reference.

### Checklist Before Asking for Help

* Confirm both API tokens are active and scoped correctly
* Compare audit vs. migrated item counts
* Check `migration_mapping.json` for missing IDs
* Search console logs for `ERROR` or `429`
* Verify no network or disk errors occurred

If problems persist, open a support ticket with a description of the error and the script version.
