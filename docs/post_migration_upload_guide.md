# Post-Migration Attachment Upload Guide

## Quick Start

After running the migration script, you'll see:

```
================================================================================
POST-MIGRATION: Attachment Handling
================================================================================

8 attachments were downloaded to: attachments_temp/

To upload attachments to GitHub issues:
1. Navigate to the issue on GitHub
2. Click the comment box  
3. Drag and drop the file from attachments_temp/
4. The file will be uploaded and embedded
```

## Step-by-Step: Uploading an Attachment

### 1. Locate the Attachment

```bash
cd attachments_temp/
ls -lh
```

Output:
```
screenshot.png          2.3M
design-mockup.pdf       5.1M
error-log.txt          150K
```

### 2. Find Which Issue It Belongs To

Check the migration console output or look for the comment on GitHub. Each issue with attachments has a comment like:

```markdown
ðŸ“Ž **Attachment from Bitbucket**: `screenshot.png` (2.3 MB)

*Note: This file was attached to the original Bitbucket issue. 
Due to GitHub API limitations, the file content is available 
in the migration artifacts directory.*
```

### 3. Open the GitHub Issue

Navigate to: `https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER`

### 4. Upload the File

**Option A: Add New Comment with File**
1. Scroll to bottom of issue
2. Click in the comment text box
3. Drag `attachments_temp/screenshot.png` into the box
4. You'll see upload progress
5. File URL appears: `![screenshot](https://github.com/...)`
6. Add any text if desired
7. Click "Comment"

**Option B: Edit Existing Attachment Comment**
1. Find the comment that says "ðŸ“Ž Attachment from Bitbucket"
2. Click "..." menu â†’ "Edit"
3. Drag the file into the comment editor
4. Update text if needed
5. Click "Update comment"

### 5. Verify Upload

- Image files will preview inline
- Other files show as download links
- File is now hosted by GitHub permanently

## Bulk Upload with GitHub CLI

For many attachments:

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
brew install gh  # macOS
# or from https://cli.github.com

# Authenticate
gh auth login

# Upload script
#!/bin/bash
cd attachments_temp

# Assuming you have a mapping file
while IFS=',' read -r file issue_num; do
  echo "Uploading $file to issue #$issue_num"
  gh issue comment "$issue_num" \
    --repo OWNER/REPO \
    --body "**Attachment:** $file" \
    --attach "$file"
  sleep 2  # Rate limiting
done < attachment_mapping.csv
```

## Prioritization Guide

### Critical (Upload First)
- Screenshots showing bugs/issues
- Design mockups currently in use
- Important documents referenced in active discussions
- Configuration files that are templates
- Error logs for open issues

**How to identify:**
- Recent attachments (last 6 months)
- On open issues
- Multiple comments referencing them
- Large files (important enough to be big)

### Medium Priority
- Historical screenshots
- Log files for closed issues
- Test data that might be useful
- Documentation files

### Low Priority (Optional)
- Temporary/scratch files
- Files available elsewhere
- Outdated documents
- Files on resolved issues from 1+ year ago

### Skip Entirely
- Broken/corrupt files
- Duplicate files
- Files explicitly marked as "temp"
- Auto-generated files

## Attachment Tracking Template

Create a file `attachment-status.md`:

```markdown
# Attachment Upload Status

## Summary
- Total Attachments: 8
- Uploaded: 3
- Pending: 5
- Skipped: 0

## Upload Log

- [x] Issue #5: `screenshot.png` (2.3 MB) - Uploaded by Alice on 2025-10-18
- [x] Issue #12: `design-mockup.pdf` (5.1 MB) - Uploaded by Bob on 2025-10-18

```

## Tips & Tricks

### 1. Preview Before Upload
```bash
# For images
open attachments_temp/screenshot.png

# For text files
cat attachments_temp/error-log.txt | head -20
```

### 2. Check File Size
```bash
ls -lh attachments_temp/
# GitHub has 25MB limit for web uploads
# Larger files need Git LFS or external hosting
```

### 3. Rename Confusing Files
```bash
cd attachments_temp/
mv "Screen Shot 2024-01-15.png" "issue-5-login-error.png"
```

### 4. Create Issue Links Document
```bash
# Map files to issues
grep "Attachment from Bitbucket" ~/migration.log > attachment-map.txt
```

### 5. Backup Before Cleanup
```bash
# After uploading everything important
tar -czf attachments_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz attachments_temp/
mv attachments_backup_*.tar.gz ~/migration_backups/
```

## Common Issues

### Upload Fails (File Too Large)
**Problem:** File >25MB  
**Solution:** 
- Use Git LFS for very large files
- Upload to Google Drive/Dropbox and add link in comment
- Compress file if possible

### Wrong Issue
**Problem:** Uploaded to wrong issue  
**Solution:**
- Delete the comment
- Re-upload to correct issue
- Or just add a new comment on correct issue

### File Type Not Supported
**Problem:** Executable or restricted file type  
**Solution:**
- Zip the file first
- Upload to external storage and link
- Convert to allowed format if possible

### Lost Track of Which File Goes Where
**Problem:** Forgot which attachment belongs to which issue  
**Solution:**
- Search GitHub for "Attachment from Bitbucket" comments
- Check original Bitbucket issue
- Look at file creation dates vs issue dates

## Cleanup After Upload

### Wait Period
Keep `attachments_temp/` for at least 30 days after migration to ensure:
- All critical files uploaded
- Team had time to request any missing files
- No issues discovered requiring original files

### Backup Before Delete
```bash
# Create archive
cd ..
tar -czf migration_attachments_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz attachments_temp/

# Move to safe location
mv migration_attachments_*.tar.gz ~/backups/

# Verify archive
tar -tzf ~/backups/migration_attachments_*.tar.gz | head
```

### Final Cleanup
```bash
# After 30+ days and team confirmation
rm -rf attachments_temp/

# Keep these files permanently
# - migration_mapping.json
# - audit_report.md  
# - migration_attachments_YYYYMMDD.tar.gz (backup)
```

See: [link to this guide]

Thanks!
```

## Metrics to Track

- Total attachments: `ls attachments_temp/ | wc -l`
- Total size: `du -sh attachments_temp/`
- Uploaded count: Track in status document
- Time spent: Estimate ~2-5 minutes per file

## Success Criteria

âœ… All critical attachments (top 20%) uploaded within 1 week  
âœ… Important attachments (next 30%) uploaded within 2 weeks  
âœ… Team has access to all files they need  
âœ… Original files backed up  
âœ… Tracking document maintained  
âœ… No blockers due to missing attachments

**Remember:** You have the original files in Bitbucket as backup. No rush to upload everything immediately. Focus on what the team actually needs!
