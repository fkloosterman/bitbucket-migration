# Bitbucket ‚Üí GitHub Migration Tools

This repository provides a set of Python-based tools and documentation to assist in migrating repositories from **Bitbucket Cloud** to **GitHub**. It covers the full process ‚Äî from auditing and mirroring git history to migrating issues, pull requests, and attachments.

The goal is to provide a **reliable, transparent, and repeatable migration workflow** that minimizes manual steps while ensuring that all relevant metadata is preserved.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Disclaimer

**Migration Tools Created with Claude.ai**

These migration tools were developed with assistance from Claude.ai, an AI language model by Anthropic. While every effort has been made to ensure the tools are reliable and safe:

- **Use at your own risk**: Always perform a dry run (`--dry-run` flag) before actual migration
- **Backup your data**: Ensure you have backups of your Bitbucket repositories before migration
- **Review and verify**: Carefully review the migration report and verify the results
- **Test thoroughly**: Test the migration process in a non-production environment first

The tools follow a conservative migration strategy (e.g., closed PRs become issues rather than GitHub PRs) to minimize risks, but repository migrations involve complex metadata and edge cases that may require manual intervention.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Audit and analyze** Bitbucket repositories before migration
* **Migrate commits, branches, tags, issues, PRs, and comments** with full metadata preservation
* **Intelligent PR migration strategy**: OPEN PRs with existing branches become GitHub PRs, others become issues (safest approach)
* **Automatic link rewriting**: Cross-references between issues/PRs are automatically updated to point to GitHub
* **Comprehensive attachment handling**: Downloads all attachments and inline images with GitHub CLI upload support
* **Advanced user mapping**: Maps Bitbucket users to GitHub accounts with support for unmapped users
* **Dry-run capability**: Simulate entire migration without making changes to validate configuration
* **Comprehensive reporting**: Detailed markdown reports with migration statistics and troubleshooting notes
* **Placeholder issue creation**: Preserves original numbering with placeholders for deleted/missing content
* **Generate mapping and verification reports**: Machine-readable mapping and comprehensive migration reports
* **Attachment/image upload support**: For attachments and images with clear guidance and automated options
* **Step-by-step documentation** and checklists for every phase of the migration process
